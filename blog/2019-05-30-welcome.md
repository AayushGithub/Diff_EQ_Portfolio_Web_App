I am a sophomore at Johns Hopkins University majoring in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I am proficient in Python, Java and React JS/React Native frameworks.
I am extremely passionate about the fields of Biomolecular sciences and Software Engineering, and always hope to find an amalgam between the two.
