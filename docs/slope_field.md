title: What is a slope field?
---


### *From Problem Set 1:  Exercise 1.1*

 The **slope field** of a first order ODE, is a way to graphically display the solutions to the specified differential equations.


 It is made of several line segments, each of which has a slope determined by the ODE. This means that the slopes of these line segments is the value of the derivative term from the ODE, or the  ![my equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.download?%5Cbg_white%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bd%7Dy%20%7D%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bd%7D%20x%7D)-form term.

Each arrow or line segment is **actually the tangent to the actual solutions** at that point.

Slope fields can be **helpful to understand the overall behavior** of the ODE as the variables involved change value.
